Entanglements.01 is an interactive kinetic painting with hand control via your camera (Dont forget to allow your camera on your browser!). A machine learning model from mediapipe libraries is used for hand landmark detection. P5 Library is used for the flowfield technique which creates the smooth vectoral movements of tentacles. Aesthetically it aims to tribute to the machine revolution in the Matrix Iconography.
